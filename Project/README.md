### NAN AIR TICKETING SOFTWARE

### Introduction:
This software was created for Chuck Norris's imaginary company called Nan air, where division by zero makes sense, in a first 
year computer science class in Reykjavik University. In the software the user is asked if he is a manager or an employee and 
depending on the answer the user is prompted with different options. Managers are supposed to be able to create new: employees, locations, properties and maintenance requests. As well as look up employees, properties, locations, and maintenance requests 
with appropriate filters. Employees are supposed to be able to look up employees, properties, locations and open maintenance 
requests. Then they can add a maintenance report on maintenance requests which the manager can then accept to close the 
request.

The idea with this project is to develop our teamworking, programming and conflict resolution skills. But the group 
struggled a lot with git. Another pain point throughout the project was communication. The group as a whole almost disbanded in
the second week. But after everything all the group members prevailed and we managed to pull together a decent project

### Requirements:
    o Python3 
    o git
    o A working computer with some kind of terminal
    
### Instructions:
To get the project you have to clone the repository onto your computer. 
To do that you have to open your terminal and use the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kommi23/Verklegt-namskeid1-T-113-VLN1---Hopur-37
```
After that use your terminal to navigate to the "Verklegt-namskeid1-T-113-VLN1---Hopur-37" folder. Do NOT go into the Project 
folder as then the code will run, but it wont be able to read the files where the data is stored.
Once in the folder you can use the following command to run the file:
```
python3 "./Project/main.py"
```
And that's it. Congratulations You can now see how the program works! üëèüëè
